# Project Description
## Introduction
- Data from the real world is unlikely to be presented to me in a neatly formatted CSV file where I just have to pick a model and start training; usually, there is much more effort involved. I have created this project to work on my skills to handle unbalanced datasets, which can present a challenge to conventional models and sampling techniques
- I have used a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions in a time span of two years. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants. It contains various information about the transactions, such as personal information about the owner and relevant details about the transaction, such as the amount spent, the date and location, etc.

- The dataset is found here on the Kaggle Website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/code
## Preprocessing for Data Analysis
- I have divided preprocessing into two categories: Data Analysis and Training/Building. This is because I wanted to gain a deeper insight into the data before manipulating or encoding any features that might be relevant for the analysis. As the first step, i checked for any duplicated and missing values but there were none present
- This dataset provided the date of birth of each account owner
